# Find_E_Or_PI_To_The_Nth_Digit

This program is meant to allow a user to find the value of either E or Pi to the number of decimal places they specify.

If a user hits 'enter' in the opening screen they will be prompted with a message stating 
>"Invalid input, please enter either 'e' or 'pi'"

Once the user chooses between E or Pi they will be taken to the next prompt.

With the instructions of either 
>Enter a positive number up to '14' and this program will generate E up to that many decimal places

>Enter 's' to switch to finding the Nth digit of Pi

>Enter 'q' to quit the program"

or

>"Enter a positive number up to '14' and this program will generate Pi up to that many decimal places

>Enter 's' to switch to finding the Nth digit of E

>Enter 'q' to quit the program"

Once the user chooses between E or Pi, they can switch between the two(even without entering a number) by typing "s."

The user can also quit the program at anytime by typing "q."
